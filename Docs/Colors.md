Great start! Based on your content and your focus, I’d recommend organizing the `colors.md` file like a **Tailwind CSS Color Reference** page, making it:

* Visually organized ✅
* Easy to copy-paste ✅
* Consistent format ✅
* Accurate naming ✅
* Informative (note on black/white) ✅

# 🎨 Tailwind CSS Colors

Tailwind provides a range of utility classes to set **text** and **background** colors. Below are some commonly used color examples.

---

## 📝 Text Colors (Example: Blue)

Use the following to change **text color**:

```

text-blue-50
text-blue-100
text-blue-200
text-blue-300
text-blue-400
text-blue-500
text-blue-600
text-blue-700
text-blue-800
text-blue-900
text-blue-950

````

> ❗ **Note:** Colors like `text-black` and `text-white` are **not part of the shade scale**. Use them directly:
>
> ```
> text-black
> text-white
> ```

---

## 🧱 Background Colors (Example: Red)

Use the following to change **background color**:

````

bg-red-50
bg-red-100
bg-red-200
bg-red-300
bg-red-400
bg-red-500
bg-red-600
bg-red-700
bg-red-800
bg-red-900
bg-red-950

````

> ❗ **Note:** `bg-black` and `bg-white` are available directly but **do not follow the numeric scale**:
>
> ```
> bg-black
> bg-white
> ```

## 💡 Tip

You can replace `blue` and `red` with other color names such as:

- `green`
- `yellow`
- `gray`
- `purple`
- `pink`
- `emerald`
- ...and many more!

Example:
````

text-green-500
bg-purple-700

```

Would you like me to generate a few sample `.md` files like this (`width.md`, `height.md`, `colors.md`) and give you a downloadable `.zip` with a README and docs structure?
